### Overview
For Georgia Tech's Hacklytics '24 (Data Science Hackathon), we created PocDoc, an app that triages mobile health units to patients based on severity level. Patients interact with a medical-trained language model from Hugging Face to predict the severity of their condition.

### Methodology
We use k-means clustering, linear regression modeling (based on current local hospital burden, patient's severity level, and pre-existing conditions), and the patient's geographical location to dispatch mobile health units to a given area.

### Goals
The goal is to benefit overburdened healthcare facilities in metro areas and improve access to healthcare in rural areas.

### Technologies Used
We used the OpenAI API for patient interaction and the Mapbox API to display an interactive map of patients and their assigned mobile units.
